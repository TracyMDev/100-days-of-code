# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 02, 2022


**Today's Progress**: Continued on my Domestika course project of building a memory card game in Javascript

**Thoughts:** I spent like 10 min trying to figure out why my error-match functions were throwing erros.  Finally realized I had the wrong case in the foreach function in element.classList I had classlist instead =[


### Day 2: January 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**:  Today I added a little countdown timer to the memory game.

**Thoughts**: I understood the logic that was needed for the timer pretty well. Day 2 is a day late, i'm off to a rough start.  I can already see this will be quite difficult to keep up with.


### Day 3: January 5, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Missed the previous day because of production work issue.  But i'm back today.  I finished my little card game.  Added user feedback pages when a user wins or loses, a move counter, sound fx, and levels!  Project # 1 is completed.  Tomorrow I plan to start on the next project.
