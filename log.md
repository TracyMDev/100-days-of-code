# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 02, 2022


**Today's Progress**: Continued on my Domestika course project of building a memory card game in Javascript

**Thoughts:** I spent like 10 min trying to figure out why my error-match functions were throwing erros.  Finally realized I had the wrong case in the foreach function in element.classList I had classlist instead =[


### Day 2: January 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**:  Today I added a little countdown timer to the memory game.

**Thoughts**: I understood the logic that was needed for the timer pretty well. Day 2 is a day late, i'm off to a rough start.  I can already see this will be quite difficult to keep up with.


### Day 3: January 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the card game! Added user feedback pages when a user wins or loses, a move counter, sound fx, and levels!  

**Thoughts** Missed the previous day because of production work issue.  But i'm back today.  I finished my little card game.  Project # 1 is completed.  Tomorrow I plan to start on the next project.

### Day 4: January 7, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started on he sample projects from Freecode camps  Vanilla Javascript course. 

**Thoughts** SometimesI get frustratedwith these tutorialsbecause they don't full explain WHY something is done, the speaker just says "We will be adding this in a foreach loop"... but why?? What are we doing?  It took me a few min to realize it's easier to add the Event listener to all the objets we grabbed in the for each loop instead of going 1 by one and adding it for each button.  I get frustrated because I am used to working with sets  of data, not objects so it's difficult to go from set based-thinking to Object based thinking...

### Day 5: January 8, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on the Javascript Free Code Camp sample projects -- Created a Review Page

**Thoughts** I'm finding the walk through of the peojects are lacking some explanations -- ex: what the DOM objects are is not explained at all, the speaker just says: Add an event listener for this dom object... And I had no idea what the DOMContentLoaded object is or does...

### Day 6: January 9, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on the Javascript Free Code Camp sample projects -- Completed 2 projects - Navigation bar and side bar

**Thoughts** I was able to complete two projects today, I spent some time reading about the DOM Object I had questions about yesterday, I kind of understand what they were doing but still kind of not.  I did notice that the sample "starter" code that was provided had an error in the CSS and it wasnt working... so I just copied from the CSS in the completed project folder and thatr fixed my problem, was kind of annoying because I don't know exactly what was wrong. Since i'm not focusing on CSS or HTML in this challenge i'll just take it and copy what was working.
I am finding that I need to refresh my skils on HTML and CSS though.


### Day 7: January 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on the Javascript Free Code Camp sample projects -- Finished 2 peojects a Q&A Page and a video page

**Thoughts**  The 2 projects I completed were instersting and now getting into a bit more advanced stuff.  I am getting a bit more familiar with the DOM and how access things. I did need to pause the video and go back a few times to fully understand what was going on.

### Day 8: January 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on the Javascript Free Code Camp sample projects -- Started on a menu page

**Thoughts**  This one was bit challenging becauset there were a few differnt issues we had to take of with the javascript, the page is more dynamic so we need to take that into account when creating the elements. Some new functions like reduce and map were used which im not completley comfortable with but I'll need to research more about those on my own later.

### Day 9: January 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on the Javascript Free Code Camp sample projects -- Finished up the Dynamic menu page

**Thoughts**  I had to keep going back and rewatching so may pieces of the second part of this video.  Displaying the filter buttons dynamically was not well explaining for a beginner in my opinion. I think i'll need to review this one when im done with the serieis.

### Day 10: January 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on the Javascript Free Code Camp sample projects -- Started on scrolling navigation page

**Thoughts**  This project was intersting and its cool to see how these single page sites with the scrolling navigation are created. i'm seeing that sometimes we need to use JS to correct things that don't 100% work as expected on the pages, like missing the section when you scroll; I would expect something so simple to just work.

### Day 11: January 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on the Javascript Free Code Camp sample projects -- Finished up the scrolling navigation page & tab navigation page

**Thoughts**  The end of the scrolling page was kind of confusing because you need to take into account the size of some elements when they arent created yet. I find it a bit wierd, and im hoping a more advanced framework can account for this stuff? Tabbed nagivation was pretty straight forward and I felt like I understood what he was doing.

### Day 12: January 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on the Javascript Free Code Camp sample projects -- C0untdown timer

**Thoughts**  I really enjoyed this countdown timer project, we had to take into account many differnt things when it cam to calculating th tim let, but it all made sense to me in the end. It really cool to see the time updating in realtime with out mamually refreshing the page.

### Day 13: January 16, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on the Javascript Free Code Camp sample projects -- Grocery List

**Thoughts**  This project is a pretty long one, got about 1/4 way through it, it's definatley the most involved out of all of them so far. Ive been consistent with coding for 1hr a day, but justs not updating GitHub  Instagram gets the update on the same day though.

### Day 14: January 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on the Javascript Free Code Camp sample projects -- continued Grocery List

**Thoughts**  Some new functions were introduced, It eventually makes sense but the video goes a bit too fast while i'm typing, I have to pause and go back a lot, look at my code and think through when we just did.

### Day 15: January 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on the Javascript Free Code Camp sample projects -- continued Grocery List still....

**Thoughts**  Today the project went into the local storage functionality, it's intersting to work with. took the while hour again to get through building the storage functionality.  I should be finished in the next day.

### Day 16: January 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on the Javascript Free Code Camp sample projects -- finished Grocery List, finished image slider page.

**Thoughts**  skipped the previous day but came right back to coding.  I was able to complete the grocery list today, plus an image slider page.  The grocery list will probably be something I will review and try to code from scratch again in my own way becaue it uses many important concepts like creating, updating and deleting data that is saved in the browser's local storage.

### Day 17+: Please check my blog and instagram for check in posts and daily progress.
