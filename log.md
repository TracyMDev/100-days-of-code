# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 02, 2022


**Today's Progress**: Continued on my Domestika course project of building a memory card game in Javascript

**Thoughts:** I spent like 10 min trying to figure out why my error-match functions were throwing erros.  Finally realized I had the wrong case in the foreach function in element.classList I had classlist instead =[


### Day 2: 

**Today's Progress**:  Today I added a coun to my little countdown timer to the memory game.

**Thoughts**: I understood the logic that was needed for the timer pretty well. Day 2 is a day late, i'm off to a rough start.  I can already see this will be quite difficult to keep up with.


### Day 3: 

**Today's Progress**:
