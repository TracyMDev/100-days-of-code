# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 02, 2022


**Today's Progress**: Continued on my Domestika course project of building a memory card game in Javascript

**Thoughts:** I spent like 10 min trying to figure out why my error-match functions were throwing erros.  Finally realized I had the wrong case in the foreach function in element.classList I had classlist instead =[


### Day 2: January 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**:  Today I added a little countdown timer to the memory game.

**Thoughts**: I understood the logic that was needed for the timer pretty well. Day 2 is a day late, i'm off to a rough start.  I can already see this will be quite difficult to keep up with.


### Day 3: January 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the card game! Added user feedback pages when a user wins or loses, a move counter, sound fx, and levels!  

**Thoughts** Missed the previous day because of production work issue.  But i'm back today.  I finished my little card game.  Project # 1 is completed.  Tomorrow I plan to start on the next project.

### Day 4: January 7, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started on he sample projects from Freecode camps  Vanilla Javascript course. 

**Thoughts** SometimesI get frustratedwith these tutorialsbecause they don't full explain WHY something is done, the speaker just says "We will be adding this in a foreach loop"... but why?? What are we doing?  It took me a few min to realize it's easier to add the Event listener to all the objets we grabbed in the for each loop instead of going 1 by one and adding it for each button.  I get frustrated because I am used to working with sets  of data, not objects so it's difficult to go from set based-thinking to Object based thinking...

### Day 5: January 8, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Kept working on the Javascript Free Code Camp sample projects -- Created a Review Page

**Thoughts** I'm finding the walk through of the peojects are lacking some explanations -- ex: what the DOM objects are is not explained at all, the speaker just says: Add an event listener for this dom object... And I had no idea what the DOMContentLoaded object is or does...
